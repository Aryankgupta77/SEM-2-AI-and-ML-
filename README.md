AI/ML Module 

# MODULE DESCRIPTION
This module provides a comprehensive foundation in key machine learning principles and techniques, focusing on the theory of generalisation, model complexity (including VC bounds), and regularisation to prevent overfitting. It equips students with the ability to apply both linear and non-linear models such as logistic regression, neural networks, and SVMs, while addressing issues like underfitting, overfitting, and data bias. The module also emphasizes best practices in model validation, selection, and evaluation, alongside an understanding of how data availability impacts model performance and decision-making in real-world machine learning tasks.
